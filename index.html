        <h2>Bunnies</h2>
        <p>Rabbits live in the wild but also make great pets. Rabbits are burrowers and live in underground tunnel networks called warrens. Their whiskers are the same width as their body and are used to determine whether they will fit through a hole, which stops them from getting stuck in tunnels. </p>
            
            <cite>When pet rabbits are happy they may jump in the air turning and twisting their bodies, a behaviour known as a binky. - <b>Ana López-Rúa</b></cite>

        <h2>The Little Ones</h2>
        <p>After you lose your baby teeth, the teeth that grow in will stay the same size and (hopefully) in the same place for the rest of your life — unless of course you have to get braces. But unlike people, a bunny’s front teeth are open-rooted, which means that they grow and grow and grow! In fact, bunny teeth can grow up to 12 centimetres each year. That’s why bunnies like to chew, chew, chew! In the wild, rabbits gnaw on twigs and bark to keep their teeth trimmed. </p>

        <h2>Some History</h2>
        <p>As the story goes, around 600 A.D. Pope Gregory the Great issued an edict declaring that rabbit fetuses, called laurices, were not meat but fish. This meant they could be eaten during Lent, a Christian period of repentance in preparation for the Easter holiday. As a result, French monks supposedly rushed to collect this new food source and breed them within the monastery walls, where they eventually grew into the loveable critters we know today.<br>

                It's a nice, neat tale of domestication. But luckily it certainly never happened.
